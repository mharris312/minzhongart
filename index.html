          <p>
            I have always been passionate about drawing since I was
            a small child. After high school I took a break from the
            doodling hobby to focus on my engineering studies. I
            graduated with degrees in Electrical Engineering and
            Computer Science and have been working as a software
            engineer for Microsoft since 2001 and then Google since
            2006. Soon after settling down in the Pacific Northwest,
            I explored various forms of artistic expression and
            rediscovered art as my true calling. My medium of choice
            is oil. I began this endeavor by taking my first oil
            painting class at the Kirkland Art Center in the fall of
            2002, and have gone on to take several workshops and
            classes from teachers such as
            <a href="http://jennifermcchristian.com/">Jennifer
              McChristian</a>, <a href="http://www.tonyryder.com/">Tony
              Ryder</a>, <a href="http://www.gageacademy.org/artists/?i_id=8&page=instructors">Matt
              Buchner</a>, <a href="http://www.michellerushworth.com/">Michele
              Rushworth</a>, and <a href="http://www.nedmueller.com/">Ned
              Mueller</a>. I am also a regular attendee of a figure drawing
            session led by Lyle Silver in Seattle. I am inspired by a
            range of historical and modern masters such as Rembrandt,
            Corot, Winslow Homer, Tony Ryder, Ted Geoschner, and Thomas
            Buechner. My artist friends Louise Britton, Lyle Silver, and
            many others are constant inspiration and help me grow
            throughout the years.
          </p>
          <p>
            I explore a variety of genres: landscape, figure,
            portrait, and still life, often weather/season
            influenced. With all these subjects, I look for both a
            visual appeal and a theme. I strive to create
            compositions that tell stories and evoke emotions with
            shapes and values. I am interested in the correct
            modeling of the forms and observation of interplay
            between form and light, and exploring how to say more
            with less, favoring simplicity over complexity. I work
            from life mainly, as I find it beneficial for my
            learning of the lighting and the modeling of forms this
            way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Art helps me see the world with gratitude, and the
            process of conveying my views has been spiritually
            meditative to me. I also find that artistic creativity
            and logical reasoning are complimentary, as the
            ingenuity, rigor, and logical decisions essential to
            both a good painting and a successful engineering
            project are quite similar. Each painting is a
            problem-solving process as much as an artistic
            expression, and I enjoy the growth from having worked
            through the process and challenges each time.
